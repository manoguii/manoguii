## About Me

I'm a <b>front end developer</b>, I've been working for a year developing web solutions, I work with technologies like React, Next.js, Typescript and Node.js. <b>I love building for the web</b>. From something as simple as a single HTML file to large applications. The web is amazing. Anyone can become a developer, or creator â€“ and no one needs to ask for permission. You can just build. I am passionate about many activities such as listening to music, riding a motorcycle and of course coding.
